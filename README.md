# Julia_Caliendo2015

  This repo include Julia code to solve multi-countries, multi-sectors with sectoral linkage model. The details of model can be obatin from Caliendo and Parro(2015).

  In the program, I set N = 2 (2 countries) and J = 2 (2 sectors). All parameters are symmetric across countries and sectors, e.g. production coeffcients, value added shares, producticities, and etc. There are couple of differences to Caliendo (2015).
