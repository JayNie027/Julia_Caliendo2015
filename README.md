# Julia_Caliendo2015

  This repo include Julia code to solve general equilibrium model with multi-countries, multi-sectors, and sectoral linkage. The details of model can be obatin from Caliendo and Parro(2015).

  In the program, I set N = 2 (2 countries) and J = 2 (2 sectors). All parameters are symmetric across countries and sectors, e.g. production coeffcients, value added shares, producticities, and etc. There are couple of differences to Caliendo (2015). 
  
  * I assume trade are balanced. One can change that by adding trade deficit in eqlibrium condition
